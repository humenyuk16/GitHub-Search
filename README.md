GitHub Users Search

Welcome to the GitHub Users Search project! This simple web application allows you to search for GitHub users based on the input you provide. It utilizes the GitHub API to fetch user data.

How to Use:

Enter your search query into the input field.
Wait for the search to load. If the search is successful, you'll see a list of users matching your query. If not, you'll receive an error message explaining why the search failed.
If no users match your query, you'll see a message indicating "No results..."
Requirements:

Display "loading..." while the search is in progress.
Show "error fetching (reason why it failed)..." if the search encounters an error.
Display "No results..." if the search yields no users.
Manage all state using the context API.
